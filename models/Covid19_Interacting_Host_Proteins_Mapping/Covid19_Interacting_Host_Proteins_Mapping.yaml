name: Covid19_Interacting_Host_Proteins_Mapping
description: Subcellular mapping of the host SARS-CoV-2 interacting proteins. through large-scale immunofluorescence and a high-throughput confocal microscopy screen. Using our existing infrastructure, personnel and unique antibody resource from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), we can directly study 330 of the 332 SARS-CoV-2 interacting host proteins while commercial antibodies for the remaining two targets can be purchased for complete coverage. To determine the baseline of subcellular localization, as well as potential relocalization upon viral infection, the screen is performed in non-infected and virus-infected cell lines. This Mapping has two aims, one is determination of the subcellular localization/relocalization of virus interacting host proteins, the other is targeted drug repurposing to identify treatments affecting virus interacting proteins.
